Soup7
===

Soup7 is the seventh version of Note Soup.  It is a browser-based sticky notes organizer.

This version is written in AngularJS, using LocalStorage.

LocalStorage is browser magic that allows modest databases to be stored locally in your browser.  Your data never travels over the network, because there is no server.

### Install

Because this is a server-free web application, you need only download and unpack the .zip file, and open the file soup7.html in your browser.

Download: https://github.com/billroy/soup7/archive/master.zip

Or navigate to a site online that hosts the code.

### About LocalStorage

Each browser has a separate LocalStorage, so you can't see your notes from browser A in browser B, even on the same computer.

Each browser also keeps separate LocalStorage for each domain.  This means notes entered on domain A are not visible from domain B.

You can use these features to create separate realms of notes.


### Privacy

The "Wipe All Workspaces" command in the workspace menu will remove all Soup7 data from your machine.
